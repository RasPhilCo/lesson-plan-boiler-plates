##Lesson Plan Boilerplates

Use these as templates when planning lessons. Teach-styles are as follows:

####Class Discussion

Topics discussed as a group, with outcomes deriving from team conversation and presentations. (i.e. Personality Type discussion)

####Code-Along

Breaking down code-intensive lessons with "I do"/"You do" splits. (i.e. Angular controllers taught via code sample)

####Divide'n'Teach

Topics researched by small teams of students and presented to the group. Usually for topics not requiring intense depth on an individual student basis. (i.e. Search Algorithms during Computer Science Week)

####Lightning Talk

30-minute student presentations (share this with the student before they do their talk to assist with planning) on topics of their choice. (i.e. multiple file uploads on Rails)

####Procedurals

Installations, deploys, and other things that require a specific order of operations and very little creativity/flexibility. (i.e. installing Rails, deploying to Heroku)
